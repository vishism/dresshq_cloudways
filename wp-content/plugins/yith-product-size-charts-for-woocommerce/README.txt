YITH Product Size Charts for WooCommerce allows you to create custom Size Charts for products in your shop.


== Description ==
YITH Product Size Charts for WooCommerce gives you the possibility to create custom size charts for any product in your shop. If you have a clothes or a shoe shop, you might well say that many of your customers' complaints concern the size they have ordered: they expected the size to be smaller or bigger; they get angry, they want their money back and/or you waste a lot of time changing the items which do not fit the size expectations of your customers. Isn't that true?
Well, this is the reason why we have developed this plugin, so that you can add a reference guide for your items, size in centimetres or inches, how to make measurements and so on. This way, the probability they order the wrong size is extremely diminished and both you and them will save a lot of time and they will have a much happier, more complete and satisfying user experience.
But, this is not all, you can customise your table as you prefer, and you might use it even for furniture measures or any other product that comes to your mind. A bit of creativity and you'll be able to adapt it to your needs.
