*STOP:* This is not the main Ninja Forms plugin. The main Ninja Forms plugin can be found here: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/>

This Ninja Forms Legacy plugin contains a legacy version of the plugin codebase and is only for existing users who have not upgraded (not to be confused with updated) their Ninja Forms installations since 2016.

If you have this plugin installed in your WordPress dashboard, [please contact our support team](https://ninjaforms.com/contact/). Support for this plugin will not / cannot be provided here.

This plugin is temporary and will be sunset/removed from WordPress.org on 31 Dec 2021. It will receive security updates only.

## What is the Ninja Forms Legacy plugin?

In 2016 a new version of the Ninja Forms codebase was released. An automated upgrade path was offered. While the vast majority of installations have since upgraded, there has been a small number of sites that have remained on the old codebase. We have continued to maintain the old codebase, and bundle it with the core plugin since then, so that these sites do not experience a total loss of their forms and submissions when it is removed.

## Ninja Forms Legacy is installed on my site currently; why?

We cannot maintain the old codebase forever, but we don't want you to suddenly have your forms stop working. Our solution was to remove the old codebase from the main plugin, and to spin off this Legacy plugin containing only the old codebase. When you updated, Ninja Forms detected that you are still using the old codebase, and auto-installed this plugin from WordPress.org alongside the main Ninja Forms plugin (now absent the old codebase).

##What should I do now?

[Please contact our support team](https://ninjaforms.com/contact/). The automated upgrade path that we built in 2016 may no longer work for you, but we are happy to help in whatever way we can.

##What happens if I don't contact support and keep using this plugin as-is?

This plugin is temporary, and will be removed from WordPress.org on 31 Dec 2021. It's our final attempt at reaching all users on the old codebase and assisting you in upgrading. It will no longer receive updates of any kind after that date, and in time become both a functionality and security liability to your site and your users.
