While women and girls have always had a love affair with summer dresses (from flirty florals to colour-blocks, micro-minis to floaty-maxis), playsuits have enjoyed a definite resurgence in popularity in the last couple of seasons.<\/p>\n<p>What is a playsuit? Put simply, it\u2019s an all-in-one garment reminiscent of onesie pyjamas. The playsuit was first popular as women\u2019s wear in the 1930\u2019s, and many a Hollywood goddess adopted the stylish yet fun look. The shorter cousin of the jumpsuit, it is shorts-length in the legs and can be <a href=\"\/dare-to-dream-playsuit\/\">long-sleeved<\/a>, short-sleeved, <a href=\"\/voltage-playsuit-black\/\">sleeveless<\/a>, or even strapless.<\/p>\n<p>The playsuit has gone in and out of style ever since, being particularly popular in the 1950\u2019s and the 1970\u2019s; silky items were worn in the evening, while daywear saw jersey and even terry-cloth garments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Playsuits are again at the forefront of summer style!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of us would remember wearing playsuits as children. But don\u2019t be fooled: playsuits are NOT just for kids \u2013 or even just for adolescent girls.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s true that many playsuits are perfectly \u201csuited\u201d to young, lithe girls, there are certainly no rules to suggest that women, even into middle age, can\u2019t also carry off the look in a classy way. It\u2019s all about choosing a piece that is age-appropriate, figure-appropriate, and occasion-appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your playsuit fits properly. A playsuit shouldn\u2019t be too tight. It should feel comfortable and be relaxed in its fit \u2013 so if necessary to achieve this, buy a size up rather than down.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy to fit your body length \u2013 if you are tall, a smaller size might result in a wedgie; while if you are short, a larger size might be too baggy around the hips and buttocks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a light and drapey fabric \u2013 one that is fluid and not shiny (unless you are very thin).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you feel comfortable? You might be someone who loves wearing a playsuit to the movies or dinner \u2013 or perhaps it works better for you as beach wear. If you are comfortable wearing a short skirt, a playsuit should work beautifully for you!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Playsuits are available in an array of leg lengths. If you\u2019re a little older, or are curvier, a leg length closer to mid-thigh may work better and be more flattering. If the legs are really short, perhaps go for a longer sleeve for a more flattering look.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider your shape. If you have larger breasts, a V-neck style is flattering. Balance a top-heavy body with fluted shorts. Balance a pear shape with embellishments or volume at the neckline. Honour an hourglass shape with tailoring and belted styles. If you are very petite, avoid larger print designs. If you\u2019re wide through the waist, go for a roomy style in a solid colour and with a small belt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A belt can work wonders. A belted, higher waistband on a playsuit can create the illusion of longer legs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Layer your playsuit with a light cardigan or even a kimono. Dress it up or down with accessories and footwear.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There really is a playsuit to flatter all body types \u2013 providing you\u2019re happy to show a little leg.
